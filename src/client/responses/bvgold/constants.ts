export const TROLL_PASTA = `No. This is not a satire.

No. We are not trolls.

No. We are not joking.

Decades ago, an evil rose from the shadows, invading every home of every Christian American family. It shattered our good and healthy ways to live, ruthlessly dragging the young folk to an abyss of filth, addiction and degeneration. Disguising itself as entertainment, this evil finally showed up its fangs, painted by innocent blood.

This evil is called video games.

Today, more and more people, calling themselves as "gamers" spend their lives in front of a screen, killing and torturing people for fun. Their eyes hurt and their fingers get tired, but they continue. "It is harmless", they say.

Gamers around the world reunite in "conventions" to talk about these vile creations that are videogames. They cheer and cackle like demons at the gate of hell while big and multi billionaire corporations fill their pockets, exploiting the pain of families victims of gamers.

While this happens, more and more blood flows between our streets. More and more children and schools are covered with screams of despair. Despair of those who are victims of the gamer.

But we resist. We will not fall. We will not perish. We will PREVAIL!

ANTI GAMERS, RISE UP!`
